  Function that create a LinearDiscriminantAnalysis (LDA) fited with the extracted features from the train section of the given dataloader.
  Then the given MLP is fited with the transformed features list returns by the LDA created.

  Finaly we get the accuracy from the method score of MLP. We do this for both section training and validation
